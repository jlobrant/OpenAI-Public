I'm curious. Will I be getting a physical card as proof of coverage? So, the default is a digital membership card, but we can send you a physical card if you prefer. Yes. Could you please mail it to me when it's ready? I'd like to have it shipped to... Are you ready for my address? So, it's 2660 Unit A on Maple Avenue, Southeast Lansing, and the zip code is 48823.
